# WordSearch

Welcome to the *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* Word Search Kata README.

This README contains instructions to run all application tests from the terminal(Mac) or Bash(Windows) using Maven.

To take these steps you will need:
- Java 1.7+
- Maven

Please take the following steps to clone and test the kata:
1. Clone or download the repo to a chosen directory.
2. From the command line, navigate to the *WordSearch* folder inside your chosen directory. (Note: If you downloaded directly rather than cloned, the folder may be called *WordSearch-master*).
3. Type: *mvn test* and press *Enter*. 
4. The app will build, run all tests, and execute the *Main* class. 

Please direct any questions to: gbreitenbeck@gmail.com

Thank you for your interest in this kata!
